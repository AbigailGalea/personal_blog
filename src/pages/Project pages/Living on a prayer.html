    <h1>Living on a Prayer.</h1>
    <p>
     This project is inspired by John Oliver’s segments on televangelists and
     ‘Our lady of perpetual exemption’. In these segments, Oliver sarcastically
     and satirically comments on the large number of organisations labelled as
     churches across the United States, and how these organisations avoid paying
     taxes on their income due to this label. With this in mind, I thought it
     might be interesting to see which states currently house the most of
     these organisations, in absolute numbers but also in comparison to population
     numbers in the state.

     A headless browser was deployed through RSelenium,
     to gather information from the Wikipedia page which contained all churches 
     with weekly attendances of more than 2,000 (which would classify them as megachurches). 
     This step could have also been skipped and the URL was directly input into
     a GET request as in the next chunk of code. Here, RSelenium was used for
     the sake of experimentation.

     After cleaning the data and processing it, everything was plotted onto an interactive map
     of the USA, in leaflet:
