  <h1>No place like homes.</h1>  
  <p>
    Growing up, I have always lived in Malta, an
    archipelago of three tiny islands in the middle of
    the Mediterranean. In the summer of 2020 I
    moved to Norrkoping in Sweden to pursue my
    Master’s degree at Linkoping University. I left
    Malta and two flights later I was in Stockholm. I
    spent the next year and a half living and
    exploring Sweden. I found these two countries
    culturally quite different. I found myself in new
    situations and thinking in new ways. I made a lot
    of new friends along the way and missed the
    ones back in Malta.
    After this experience, I find myself at a
    crossroads- I am unsure of where to call home.
    Through this exhibition I wanted to capture the
    essence of my memories in both places. When
    faced with this dilemma, where do you call
    home?
    <br><br>

    This project was made using Unity Engine
    (2021.2.7f1) with some assets being made and
    imported from Blender, MetaShape (by Agisoft)
    as well as online sources. For some parts of the
    production, online tutorials for Unity were also
    followed to achieve the desired effects.
    The following subsections will explain the
    process of making and putting together
    everything. Firstly a brief explanation of how the
    first person controller was made will be given.
    The set up of space and portal will be
    explained. Then an explanation will be given for
    how the height maps of the countries were
    made. The process of making the picture
    frames in Blender will be explained. I will also
    describe briefly how the spin animation was
    added to the boat model and in the following
    subsection an explanation of how the
    mirrors on the wall were made and rendered
    will be given. An explanation of how
    photogrammetry was used to create the 3D
    model of the pastizzi will be given. A 
    short description of the user interface will be
    given.

  <h1>First person controller (FPC)</h1> 
  <p>
    To make the first person controller which the
    user could use to explore the exhibit, I followed
    Brackey’s tutorial on YouTube for building an
    FPC. To summarise the process; one first has to create
    a player object with a character controller
    component and capsule which acts as the
    player’s body. Then one adds a camera which
    will act as the viewport (i.e. player’s eyes) and
    aligns it to where the eyes of the player would
    be.
    <br><br>

    A script was added for controlling the movement
    of the camera using the mouse. The main idea of
    this script is that as the mouse is moved left and
    right, the entire player body is spun around.
    When the mouse is moved up or down the
    vertical angle of the camera is shifted.
    Combining these two functions together allows
    the player to look around them (360° on the
    x-axis and 180° on the y-axis).
    <br><br>

    Furthermore, another script was used to allow the
    player to move around using the arrow keys.
    Essentially this script took key presses as
    controls to transform the location of the player
    within the world, taking into consideration the
    current location and looking direction.
  </p>

  <h1>Portal set-up</h1> 
  <p>
    When exploring the space, one is able to
    transition between Malta’s exhibit and Sweden’s
    exhibit by passing through a portal. To set this
    up, another tutorial by Brackeys was followed.
    <br><br>

    The set-up starts off with two areas being
    created. Portals are then added to both rooms
    and flat planes are placed inside them facing
    opposite directions. Similar to the process of
    making mirrors (explained later in the mirrors section),
    the planes used camera images to constantly render and
    show what the other world looked like based on
    where the player was positioned and looking.
    <br><br>

    Using scripts and an additional collider plane in
    every portal, the player was then allowed to move
    from one world to another. When the
    player body collides with the plane inside the portal
    from the correct direction, their body is moved to
    the location of the other plane with a few
    adjustments to make the transition feel natural.
  </p>

<h1>Height maps</h1>
  <p>
    Using black and white 2D height maps available
    online for Malta and Sweden, Blender was used to build 3D height
    maps. The process involved importing the 2D
    images into Blender and then using their pixel
    brightness as an indicator of height. The darkest
    (completely black) pixels were displaced most
    along the y-axis. This process gave a 3D map of
    heights in different places.
  </p>

<h1>Picture frames</h1>
  <p>
    Making the picture frames in Blender was a
    relatively simple process. Two cubes were
    resized and shaped and then one was
    subtracted from the other using the boolean
    operator to give the frame shape. A different
    material was given to the face which would hold
    the image and the model was exported to Unity.
  </p>

<h1>Boat spinning animation</h1>
  <p>
    To create the boat spinning animation I followed
    a short tutorial by Windows. The basic idea of
    the script which spins the boat, is that at every
    rendered frame, the rotation of the boat is
    changed along the chosen axis by a given
    amount (based on speed chosen).
  </p>

<h1>Mirrors</h1>
  <p>
    When looking at the boat model in the Malta
    side of the museum, visitors are able to see
    themselves as a capsule in a mirror, as they
    move around, so does their character in the
    mirror surface. This was done using a camera
    facing outwards from the mirror surface
    projecting onto a render texture which was
    applied to the mirror’s material. This way, the
    camera was able to take in a video input of the
    scene and concurrently display it on the mirror’s
    surface.
  </p>

<h1>Photogrammetry asset</h1>
  <p>
    The 3d model of the pastizzi was made using
    MetaShape by Agisoft, following the instructions
    given in the course by Masaki Hayashi.
    19 pictures of the pastizzi were taken from
    various angles using a Huawei mobile phone
    camera. Then using the workflow menu the
    photos were aligned and a dense point cloud
    was built based on that. Based on the dense
    cloud, a mesh was built as well as a texture
    based on the pictures. The model was then
    briefly edited in Blender, to remove the flooring,
    and imported into the Unity project as a model
    with a texture.
  </p>

<h1>Controls UI</h1>
  <p>
    To allow users to be able to see what controls
    they need to move around in the environment
    and control their character, a small interface was
    added. The user could press a button at the
    bottom left corner (“Controls”) and they would
    get instructions on how to operate their
    character. By pressing the same button again
    they could then hide the panel again and
    continue viewing the museum. This was done by
    attaching a short script to a UI button object,
    which activated and deactivated the controls
    help panel depending on the current status.
  </p>

<h1>Description of final product</h1>
  <p>
    The final product of this work was a 3D virtual
    museum project in Unity. Visitors to this virtual
    museum could walk around the space and
    explore the different pictures and 3D models.
    Upon entering the museum, the visitor sees a
    wall of pictures of Malta, on a traditional
    limestone brick wall, and a floor covered in
    traditional Maltese tiles. To their left
    they see a portal arch that leads to Sweden’s
    exhibit, ahead of them, a 3D model of a
    traditional Maltese fishing boat called a Kajjik
    (Fig.3.2).
    <br><br>

    The pictures on the walls seek to capture life on
    the Maltese islands whereas the height map
    (Fig. 3.3) indicates what the topology of the
    landscape looks like. The scanned model of
    traditional food, a pastizz, represents culture and
    day to day life (Fig.3.4).
    <br><br>

    When the visitor is done looking around Malta’s
    exhibit they can then walk through the arch to
    Sweden. Here visitors can again look at pictures
    of Sweden as well as the height map of the
    land. As for a Swedish tradition, I chose to
    present a Dalahäst asset (fig. 3.5) which I
    downloaded from an online website. This model
    reminds me of life in Sweden because I got one
    as a Christmas gift from one of my friends in
    Sweden and I always keep it in my room.
  </p>

<h1>Evaluation</h1>
  <p>
    To review how the museum was received, the
    project was made available online at the
    following link:
    <br>
    <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-131003">https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-131003</a>
    <br>
    The link was then sent to family and friends and
    as of the time of writing this report, the game
    had 32 views, 30 plays, 6 comments and 3
    (positive) reactions. The feedback collected
    through the comments section was also positive,
    indicating that the online visitors had enjoyed
    the experience. Through private messages, some
    commented that they were unsure about how to
    control the character, for this reason I added the
    controls button in the UI of the final project. I
    also moved the labels for the 3D models from
    the side to the top since some people informed
    me that they were not easy to read in their initial
    position on the side.
    <br><br>

    This project showcased the work undertaken
    over the span of a few months as well as
    pictures gathered over the past years. In this
    personal collection, the museum visitors could
    hopefully get a better feeling for what life is like
    in Malta and in Sweden, the colours that colour
    both places and the distinct styles that make
    both countries so beautiful and unique.
    <br><br>

    After working on this project I have found that I
    really enjoyed using the Unity engine and I feel
    that I have a better understanding of how virtual
    spaces can be used to showcase works
    interactively. I have also learnt a lot of new skills
    within the engine.
    <br><br>

    To allow others to experience and enjoy this
    from their own computer, I made the project
    available using Unity’s Share WebGL package. I
    found the comment functionality on the website
    to also be useful for getting feedback from the
    online museum visitors.
